## Problem Statement

DTC businesses often encounter several challenges, including:

- **Overstocking or Understocking**: Poor inventory forecasting can lead to excess stock that ties up capital, or stockouts that lead to lost sales.
- **Isolated Decision Making**: DTC brands operate in silos, unable to share or leverage insights across similar businesses.
- **Lack of Accessible BI**: Small and medium DTC owners typically lack resources to build and maintain a business intelligence pipeline.
- **Manual Planning**: Marketing and sales strategies are often created based on intuition rather than data, resulting in missed opportunities.
- **Data Storage Complexity**: Managing data efficiently‚Äîbalancing between real-time analytics and long-term storage‚Äîis a challenge.
